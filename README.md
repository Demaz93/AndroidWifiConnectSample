# AndroidWifiConnectSample
This is a sample app that gives a demo of [android-wificonnect](https://www.github.com/nishkarsh/android-wificonnect).

This app does not focus on quality or any kind of performance while dealing with networks or anything else. This is just a quick demo of android-wificonnect to show the developers how the basic functionality could be achieved with it.

This app shows only the basic functionlity of library, more advanced tasks could be achieved using it. That to be implemented later.
